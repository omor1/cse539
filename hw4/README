To compile hw4.c, use the provided Makefile and the make program:
	make

To execute the compiled program:
	./hw4

hw4.c requires the mbed TLS library (formerly known as PolarSSL). The easiest
method of acquiring it is installing it from the distribution repositories; it
exists in the Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux repositories, amongst
others. If you cannot or do not wish to install it from the distribution
repositories, you can instead download the source from https://tls.mbed.org and
compile it. To download, compile and install mbed TLS in a custom location:
	curl -O https://tls.mbed.org/download/mbedtls-2.2.1-gpl.tgz
	tar xvfz mbedtls-2.2.1-gpl.tgz
	cd mbedtls-2.2.1-gpl
	make
	make install DESTDIR=/path/to/dir

If you compiled and installed mbed TLS in a custom location, you will need to
compile hw4.c thus:
	make CFLAGS=-I/path/to/dir/include LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/dir/lib
