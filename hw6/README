hw6.cpp requires C++11 support, specifically the  <array> and <random> headers
and the `auto` specifier. Compile it with the `-std=c++11` or `-std=gnu++11`
flag.

One thing of note: in question 1, part d, one combination of non-primes
resulted in decryption nevertheless working. These are the Carmichael Numbers
52633 and 62745.
